                <p>
                  SUNRISE Beverage products are intended exclusively for
                  adults 21 years of age and older. We take age verification
                  seriously and use multiple layers of verification to ensure
                  that our products do not reach minors.
                </p>

                <h3 className="av-policy-heading">How we verify age</h3>

                <h4 className="av-policy-subheading">1. At site entry</h4>
                <p>
                  When you visit www.savorsunrise.com for the first time, you
                  will be asked to confirm that you are 21 years of age or
                  older before you can browse the site. By clicking "I am
                  21+," you represent that you have read and agree to our{" "}
                  <a href="/terms-of-service">Terms of Service</a> and{" "}
                  <a href="/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a>.
                </p>

                <h4 className="av-policy-subheading">2. At checkout</h4>
                <p>
                  When you place an order, we use a third-party
                  age-verification service to confirm that the purchaser is
                  21 or older. You may be asked to provide:
                </p>
                <ul className="av-policy-list">
                  <li>Your date of birth</li>
                  <li>Your billing or shipping address</li>
                  <li>
                    In some cases, a photograph of a valid government-issued
                    identification document
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  The verification is performed by our third-party provider,
                  which uses encrypted data-handling practices and securely
                  matches your information against authoritative records.{" "}
                  <strong>
                    SUNRISE Beverage does not directly store images of your
                    government-issued identification document.
                  </strong>{" "}
                  Once your age is verified, you generally will not need to
                  verify again on the same device.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If verification fails, you may be asked to submit additional
                  information or your order may be cancelled. If your order
                  is cancelled because age verification could not be
                  completed, you will receive a full refund.
                </p>

                <h4 className="av-policy-subheading">3. At delivery</h4>
                <p>
                  All SUNRISE shipments require an{" "}
                  <strong>
                    adult signature from a person 21 years of age or older
                  </strong>{" "}
                  at delivery. The shipping carrier will check ID at delivery
                  and will not release the package to anyone under 21 or to
                  anyone who refuses to provide ID.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If a qualifying adult is not available to sign after the
                  carrier's redelivery attempts, the package will be returned
                  to us, and you will be refunded for the product cost (less
                  non-refundable shipping fees). See our{" "}
