            Hemp is a variant of the cannabis plant with 0.3% Delta-9 THC or
            less by dry weight — federally legal under the 2018 Farm Bill. It
            still carries the same psychoactive properties at higher doses, so
            we encourage customers to choose their experience based on comfort
            and habit.

          <p>
            Delta-9 THC is the cannabinoid responsible for the lift in
            cannabis. The molecule is chemically identical whether it comes
            from hemp or marijuana — what changes is legal status. Hemp-derived
            Delta-9 is federally legal at concentrations of 0.3% or less by
            dry weight.

            Minor cannabinoids — the supporting cast alongside Delta-9 THC.
            CBG tracks toward focus and uplift, CBN toward relaxation and
            unwinding, THCV toward clarity and engagement. Every variant in
            the lineup blends 30mg of one of these alongside the stated
            Delta-9 dose, shifting the character of the experience without
            changing the THC level.

        a: (
          <p>
            THC and other cannabinoids work through the endocannabinoid
            system — a network of receptors in the brain and body that helps
            regulate mood, appetite, pain, and sleep. THC binds to those
            receptors (mainly the ones called CB1 and CB2) to produce the
            lift. Receptor density and tolerance vary by person, which is why
            the same can can feel different from one body to another.

            from there. A first session is for finding where your line is —

            Not advised. Mixing potencies stacks the dose — a 10MG plus a 30MG
            is 40mg of THC, which can land harder than expected. Pick one
            potency and stay with it for the session.

            A few hours, give or take. Dose, body chemistry, and what you ate
            all shift the curve. The peak tends to be shorter than a typical
            edible, with a smoother fade on the way out.

            Emulsion and absorption. The Delta-9 THC in our seltzers is
            emulsified into microscopic droplets, which lets your body absorb
            it faster and more consistently than a typical gummy. That means
            onset around 30 to 40 minutes instead of 60 to 90, and a cleaner
            taper on the way out.

          <p>
            Different compounds, different rides. Alcohol is a depressant your
            liver works through over hours, with hangovers and dehydration as
            the cost. THC works through the endocannabinoid system and
            typically produces a shorter peak with a cleaner exit. Our
            seltzers contain no alcohol, and we'd steer clear of mixing the
            two.

          <p>
            You can, though without food the THC tends to absorb faster and
            the lift can arrive in a less predictable way. Eating something
            first lets you pace yourself and helps make for a more comfortable
            experience.
