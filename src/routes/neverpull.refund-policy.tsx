                  SUNRISE Beverage does not accept returns on beverage or
                  other edible products. Once a sealed item has left our
                  facility, food-safety standards prevent us from putting it
                  back into circulation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  That said, if something is wrong with your order, get in
                  touch. We don't process formal returns or exchanges, but we
                  handle every issue individually and work to make it right.

                  cancel before fulfillment, but we cannot guarantee
                  cancellations once an order is in fulfillment. Once an order
                  has shipped, it cannot be cancelled.

                  All SUNRISE deliveries require an adult signature from a
                  person 21 or older. If your package is returned to us
                  because no qualifying adult was available to sign after the

                  product cost only.{" "}

                <p>
                  If you refuse delivery of your order for any reason other
                  than damage or defect, the package will be returned to us.{" "}

                    Packages refused at delivery are eligible for a refund of

                  within ten (10) business days of placing your order. We will
                  work with the carrier and with you to investigate and, where
                  appropriate, issue a replacement or refund.

                <h3 className="rp-policy-heading">Purchased from a retailer</h3>

                  If you bought SUNRISE at a store, gas station, dispensary,
                  or any other third-party retailer, return and refund
                  decisions are handled by that retailer under their own
                  policy. We are not able to process complaints for purchases
                  made outside{" "}

                <h3 className="rp-policy-heading">Refunds</h3>
                <p>
                  When a refund is approved, it will be processed to your
                  original payment method within ten (10) business days.
                  Please allow additional time for your bank or card issuer to
                  post the refund on their end. If more than two (2) business
                  weeks have passed since approval and the refund still has
                  not appeared, contact us at{" "}
                  <a href="mailto:hello@savorsunrise.com">hello@savorsunrise.com</a>{" "}
                  and we will look into it.

                <p>
                  Shipping fees are not eligible for refund unless
                  specifically agreed upon in our conversations with you.

                <h3 className="rp-policy-heading">Chargebacks and payment disputes</h3>
                <p>
                  We ask that you contact us first before initiating a
                  chargeback or payment dispute. Most issues can be resolved
                  more quickly through direct communication. If you initiate a
                  chargeback for a transaction without first contacting us, we
                  may dispute the chargeback with documentation of your order,
                  delivery, and any communications.
