                  information may be transferred to, stored, and processed in
                  the United States and other countries where our service
                  providers operate. By using the Services, you consent to the
                  transfer of your personal information to the United States.

                  recognized transfer mechanisms like the European Commission's
                  Standard Contractual Clauses, or any equivalent contracts
                  issued by the relevant competent authority of the UK, as
                  relevant, unless the data transfer is to a country that has
                  been determined to provide an adequate level of protection.
