                  or delivered for these reasons, we may cancel your order,
                  and you will not be entitled to compensation beyond a refund
                  of the purchase price (less any non-refundable shipping

                <p>
                  <strong>15.1</strong> This section ("Agent Terms") applies
                  if you use, allow, enable, or cause the deployment of an
                  Agent to access, use, or interact with any Services.
                  "Agent" means any software or service that takes autonomous
                  or semi-autonomous action on behalf of, or at the
                  instruction of, any person or entity and that can be
                  executed on behalf of or using a person's device, without
                  direct supervision.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>15.2</strong> No Agent may access, use, or interact
                  with Services unless, at all times, it identifies itself
                  and operates in strict accordance with the requirements in
                  Section 15.4 below. In addition, no Agent may access, use,
                  or interact with Services if we have requested that the
                  Agent refrain from accessing, using, or interacting with
                  any service.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>15.3</strong> We may limit, including by technical
                  measures, whether and how any Agent accesses, uses, and
                  interacts with Services.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>15.4</strong> Agents must: (i) in all HTTP/HTTPS
                  requests, identify that the request is from an Agent and
                  disclose the name of the Agent by including the following
                  in the request's user agent string: "Agent/[agent name]";
                  (ii) not conceal or obfuscate that any access, use, or
                  interactions are from an Agent, such as by (a) mimicking
                  human behavior and interaction patterns, or (b) completing
                  or circumventing CAPTCHAs or measures intended to
                  distinguish computer use from humans; (iii) respond
                  truthfully to any question or prompt seeking to determine
                  if interactions are coming from a human or a computer; (iv)
                  not circumvent or otherwise avoid any measure intended to
                  block, limit, modify, or control whether and how Agents
                  access, use, or interact with the Services.

                  You and SUNRISE Beverage agree to negotiate in good faith

                  received, either party may proceed with binding arbitration
                  as set forth in Section 21. Compliance with this Section 20
                  is a condition precedent to the initiation of arbitration.
                  The thirty-day informal-resolution period shall toll any

                <h3 className="tos-policy-heading">21. Binding Individual Arbitration</h3>
                <p>
                  <strong>21.1 Agreement to Arbitrate.</strong> You and
                  SUNRISE Beverage agree that any dispute, claim, or
                  controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the
                  breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation, or
                  validity thereof, or the use of the Services or purchase of
                  any products (collectively, "Disputes"), will be resolved
                  exclusively through final and binding individual
                  arbitration, except as set forth in Section 21.5 below.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>21.2 Arbitration Rules and Forum.</strong> The
                  arbitration will be administered by JAMS pursuant to its
                  Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures then in effect
                  (the "JAMS Rules") for claims that do not exceed $250,000,
                  and pursuant to its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and
                  Procedures for claims that exceed $250,000. The JAMS Rules
                  are available at www.jamsadr.com. The arbitration will be
                  conducted by a single neutral arbitrator. The arbitration
                  will take place in Tulsa, Oklahoma, or at another location
                  mutually agreed by the parties, except that the arbitrator
                  may, at your written request, conduct the arbitration by
                  videoconference, telephone, or written submissions where
                  appropriate. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the amount
                  in controversy is $25,000 or less, the arbitration shall be
                  conducted by written submissions and telephonic or
                  videoconference hearings only, unless the arbitrator
                  determines that an in-person hearing is necessary.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>21.3 Federal Arbitration Act.</strong> This Section
                  21 (and the related provisions in Sections 22 and 23) is
                  governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §§ 1 et
                  seq. (the "FAA"). Judgment upon the arbitration award may
                  be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>21.4 Arbitrator's Authority.</strong> The arbitrator
                  shall have exclusive authority to resolve any Dispute,
                  including, without limitation, any claim that all or any
                  part of these Terms is void or voidable. The arbitrator
                  shall have the authority to grant any remedy that would
                  otherwise be available in court, except that the arbitrator
                  may not award relief that exceeds the limitations stated in
                  Section 18 (Limitation of Liability).
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>21.5 Exceptions to Arbitration.</strong>{" "}
                  Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may bring an
                  individual action in small claims court for disputes within
                  that court's jurisdiction. In addition, either party may
                  seek emergency injunctive or other equitable relief in a
                  court of competent jurisdiction to prevent or address (a)
                  infringement, misappropriation, or violation of intellectual
                  property rights; or (b) unauthorized access to or use of
                  the Services. Disputes concerning the enforceability or
                  scope of the Class Action Waiver in Section 22 shall be
                  resolved by a court of competent jurisdiction, not the
                  arbitrator.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>21.6 Costs.</strong> Each party will bear its own
                  attorneys' fees and costs in arbitration, except that the
                  arbitrator may award fees and costs to the prevailing party
                  as permitted by applicable law. The allocation of
                  arbitration filing fees, administrative fees, and arbitrator
                  compensation shall be governed by the JAMS Rules and JAMS
                  Consumer Arbitration Minimum Standards, where applicable.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>21.7 30-Day Right to Opt Out.</strong> You have the
                  right to opt out of this Section 21 (Binding Individual
                  Arbitration) and Section 22 (Class Action Waiver) by sending
                  written notice of your decision to opt out to the address
                  in Section 20 within thirty (30) days after first becoming
                  subject to these Terms. Your opt-out notice must include
                  your full name, mailing address, email address, and a clear
                  statement that you wish to opt out of arbitration. If you
                  opt out under this Section 21.7, the remainder of these
                  Terms (including Section 23 (Waiver of Jury Trial) and
                  Section 31 (Governing Law)) will continue to apply to you.
